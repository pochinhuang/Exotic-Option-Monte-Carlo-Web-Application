    "## Variance Reduction Techniques\n",
    "Variance reduction techniques are methods used to minimize the variance of results in simulations. These techniques aim to improve the accuracy of the estimates by reducing the variance, which leads to more stable and reliable outcomes. By reducing the uncertainty associated with simulations, variance reduction helps in obtaining more precise trustworthy results for pricing options.\n",

    "## Multithreading Parallel Execution\n",
    "What is Multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique used in computing which allows the CPU to manage multiple tasks at once. This is especially useful in applications where tasks can be broken down into smaller, independent parts that can be processed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Performance:  \n",
    "  By dividing tasks into smaller, parallelizable pieces, multithreading allows your application to take advantage of multi-core processors, significantly reducing the time required to complete computationally intensive tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Efficiency:  \n",
    "  Multithreading enables an application to handle multiple requests or processes at the same time, improving responsiveness and overall efficiency. For example, during simulations, multiple threads can process simulations independently, making the application more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource Management:  \n",
    "  Multithreading optimizes resource usage by dividing work into parallel tasks, allowing resources like memory and processing power to be utilized more effectively."
